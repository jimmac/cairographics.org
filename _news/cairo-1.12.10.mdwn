	Release 1.12.10 (2013-01-16 Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>)
	===================================================================
	A heap of bug fixes everywhere, and the gradual completion of the MSAA
	backend for cairo-gl. Perhaps the most noteworthy set of the bugfixes
	was the crusage lead by Behdad Eshfabod to make font handling by
	pango/cairo/fontconfig fully threadsafe. This testing revealed a couple
	of races that needed fixing in Cairo's scaled-font and glyph cache.

	Bug fixes
	---------

	  Append coincident elements to the recording's surface bbtree so that
	  the list is not corrupted and the overlapping elements lost.

	  Fix cairo-trace to correctly record map-to-image/unmap-image and then
	  replay them.

	  Ignore MappingNotifies when running the XCB testsuite as they are sent
	  to all clients when the keyboard changes. The testsuite would detect
	  the unexpected event and complain.

	  Handle very large large images in the XCB backend.

	  Fix a memory leak in the xlib/shm layer, and prevent use of the SHM
	  surfaces after the display is closed.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi

	  Handle resizing of bitmap fonts, in preparation for a fix to
	  fontconfig to correctly pass on the user request for scaling.

	  Always include subroutine 4 (hint replacement idion) when subsetting
	  type 1 fonts in order to prevent a crash in cgpdftops on Mac OS/X

	  Fix a couple of typos in the cairo-gobject.h header files for
	  introspection.

	  Prevent a mutex deadlock when freeing a scaled-glyph containing a
	  recording-surface that itself references another scaled-glyph.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54950

	  Make scaled-font cache actually thread-safe and prevent
	  use-after-frees.

	  Restore support for older versions of XRender. A couple of typos and a
	  few forgotten chunks prevented the xlib compositor from running
	  correctly with XRender < 0.10. Note that there are still a few
	  regressions remaining.
