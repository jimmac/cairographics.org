	Subject:        cairo release 1.2.6 now available
	
	A new cairo release 1.2.6 is now available from:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz
	
	    which can be verified with:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz.sha1
	        b86b4017a9abd565ef11c72b7faee9082a04118f  cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.6.tar.gz.sha1.asc
	        (signed by Behdad Esfahbod)
	
	  Additionally, a git clone of the source tree:
	
	        git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/cairo
	
	    will include a signed 1.2.6 tag which points to a commit named:
	        8878bbc549a01868853ff6270b986e57c6474d88
	
	    which can be verified with:
	        git verify-tag 1.2.6
	
	    and can be checked out with a command such as:
	        git checkout -b build 1.2.6
	
	
	This is the third bug fix release in the 1.2 series, coming less than
	two months after the 1.2.4 release made on August 18.
	
	The 1.2.4 release turned out to be a pretty solid one, except for a crasher
	bug when forwarding an X connection where the client and the server have
	varying byte orders, eg. from a PPC to an i686.  Other than that, various
	other small bugs have been fixed.
	
	Various improvements have been made in the testing infrastructure to prevent
	false positives, and to make sure the generated cairo shared object behaves as
	expected in terms of exported symbols and relocations.
	
	There were a total of 89 changes since 1.2.4.  The following list the most
	important ones:
	
	Common fixes
	------------
	- Avoid unsigned loop control variable to eliminate infinite,
	  memory-scribbling loop. (#7593)
	- Fix cairo_image_surface_create to report INVALID_FORMAT errors.
	  Previously the detected error was being lost and a nil surface was
	  returned that erroneously reported CAIRO_STATUS_NO_MEMORY.
	- Change _cairo_color_compute_shorts to not rely on any particular
	  floating-point epsilon value. (#7497)
	- Fix infinite-join test case (bug #8379)
	- Pass correct surface to create_similar in _cairo_clip_init_deep_copy().
	
	PS/PDF fixes
	------------
	- Fix Type 1 embedding in PDF.
	- Correct the value of /LastChar in the PDF Type 1 font dictionary.
	- Improve error checking in TrueType subsetting.
	- Compute right index when looking up left side bearing. (bug #8180)
	- Correct an unsigned to signed conversion problem in truetype subsetting
	  bbox.
	- Type1 subsetting: Don't put .notdef in Encoding when there are 256 glyphs.
	- Add cairo version to PS header / PDF document info dictionary.
	- Set CTM before path construction.
	
	Win32 fixes
	-----------
	- Get correct unhinted outlines on win32. (bug 7603)
	- Make cairo as a win32 static library possible.
	- Use CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24 for BITSPIXEL==32 surfaces too.
	
	Build system fixes
	------------------
	- Define WINVER if it's not defined. (bug 6456)
	- Fix the AMD64 final link by removing SLIM from pixman.
	- Misc win32 compilation fixes.
	- Add Sun Pro C definition of pixman_private.
	- Use pixman_private consistently as prefix not suffix.
	- Added three tests check-plt.sh, check-def.sh, and check-header.sh that check
	  that the shared object, the .def file, and the public headers agree about
	  the exported symbols.
	- Require pkg-config 0.19. (#8686)
	
	
	And like every time, have fun with cairo!

	What is cairo
	=============
	Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
	devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
	System, win32, and image buffers, as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG
	file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL (through glitz),
	Quartz, XCB, BeOS, and DirectFB.
	
	Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
	while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available
	(for example, through the X Render Extension).
	
	The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
	PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling
	cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,
	and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
	transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,
	etc.).
	
	Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern
	2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been
	designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not
	having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed
	somewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.
	
	Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
	modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
	License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version
	1.1.
