	Release 1.12.16 (2013-08-21 Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>)
	===================================================================
	Thanks to everybody who reported a bug and helped us develop a fix,
	we have amassed quite a few bug fixes. There are still more outstanding
	bugs that seek attention and a little bit of TLC, but this release has
	been delayed long enough...

	Bug fixes
	---------

	  Set the correct orientation for simple boxes with a negative scale
	  factor.

	  Fix the creation of the shading dictionary in PDF.

	  Fix a crash in PDF when incorporating an image with CAIRO_EXTEND_PAD.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61451

	  Avoid upscaling bitmap fonts if possible.

	  Fix an assertion failure within the mempool allocator for shared memory.

	  Fix allocation size for CFF subsets.

	  Export cairo_matrix_t for GObject bindings.

	  Fix a double free in the Quartz backend.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=62885

	  Fix origin of GDI StretchBlits for the Windows backend
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61876

	  Fix error propagation for requests to create a similar surface with
	  negative size.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=63196

	  Fix complex clipping of trapezoids with regions
	  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697357

	  Stop leaking the image data when loading PNGs

	  Fix unbounded operations with a clip mask through the span compositor
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61592

	  Add missing checks before rendering to a finished surface - so we return
	  an error rather than hit an assert.
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68014

	  Prevent an assertion failure when creating similar GL surfaces larger
	  than supported by hardware.

	  Prevent a double free of a similar image under Windows.
