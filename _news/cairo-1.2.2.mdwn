	Subject: [cairo-announce] cairo release 1.2.2 now available
	
	A new cairo release 1.2.2 is now available from:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.2.tar.gz
	
	    which can be verified with:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.2.tar.gz.sha1
	        859b9ed4eaa200a03b9e41ccc45f3799742e6c5c  cairo-1.2.2.tar.gz
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.2.2.tar.gz.sha1.asc
	        (signed by Carl Worth)
	  Additionally, a git clone of the source tree:
	
	        git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/cairo
	
	    will include a signed 1.2.2 tag which points to a commit named:
	        ac1c748868bdf4ca6fd195b184ec90827f6e8c94
	
	    which can be verified with:
	        git verify-tag 1.2.2
	
	    and can be checked out with a command such as:
	        git checkout -b build 1.2.2
	
	This is the first bug fix release in the 1.2 series since the original
	1.2.0 release made six weeks ago.
	
	There were some very serious bugs in the 1.2.0 release, (see below),
	so everybody is encouraged to upgrade from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2. The 1.2.2
	release maintains source and binary compatibility with 1.2.0 and does
	not make any API additions.
	
	I'd like to thank everybody who has done so much to make this release
	possible. Some people have their names associated with fixes below,
	but many more people have been just as valuable in testing and
	reporting bugs. And I'd like to extend special recognition to the
	people who have been patient with some major failures in cairo 1.2.0!
	
	At the risk of neglecting the dozens of people who have done so much,
	I do want to mention two people in particular:
	
	First, Behdad Esfahbod has put an untold number of hours into this
	release, with over 80 commits since the 1.2.0 release just a few weeks
	ago. His efforts are often behind-the-scenes improving the Makefiles
	and the test suites so that everyone working on cairo can do so more
	smoothly and easily. Thanks Behdad!
	
	Second, I'd like to extend a special welcome to Adrian Johnson who has
	recently started working on cairo and immediately started contributing
	very valuable improvement. His work has focused on the printing
	backends, (particularly in the area of font subsetting), which are
	much better for his efforts. Welcome Adrian!
	
	And to everybody, have fun with cairo!
	
	-Carl
	
	What's new in cairo 1.2.2 compared to 1.2.0
	===========================================
	Fix crashes with BGR X servers
	------------------------------
	With cairo 1.2.0 many people reported problems with all cairo-using
	programs, (including all GTK+ programs with GTK+ >= 2.8) immediately
	crashing with a complaint about an unsupported image format. This bug
	affected X servers that do not provide the Render extension and that
	provide a visual with BGR rather than RGB channel order.

	fix:    http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=cairo;a=commit;h=9ae66174e774b57f16ad791452ed44efc2770a59
	
	Fix the "disappearing text" bug
	-------------------------------
	With cairo 1.2.0 many people reported that text would disappear from
	applications, sometimes reappearing with mouse motion or
	selection. The text would disappear after the first space in a string
	of text. This bug was caused by an underlying bug in (very common) X
	servers, and only affected text rendered without antialiasing, (either
	a bitmap font or a vector font with antialiasing disabled). The bug
	was also exacerbated by a KDE migration bug that caused antialiasing
	to be disabled more than desired.

	Fix broken image fallback scaling (aka. "broken printing")
	----------------------------------------------------------
	The various "print" backends, (pdf, ps, and svg), sometimes fallback
	to using image-based rendering for some operations. In cairo 1.2.0
	these image fallbacks were scaled improperly. Applications using cairo
	can influence the resolution of the image fallbacks with
	cairo_surface_set_fallback_resolution. With the bug, any value other
	than 72.0 would lead to incorrect results, (larger values would lead
	to increasingly shrunken output).

	Fix inadvertent semantic change of font matrix translation (Behdad Esfahbod)
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The 1.2.0 release introduced an inadvertent change to how the
	translation components of a font matrix are interpreted. In the 1.0
	series, font matrix translation could be used to offset the glyph
	origin, (though glyph metrics were reported incorrectly in
	1.0). However in 1.2.0, the translation was applied to the advance
	values between each glyph. The 1.2.0 behavior is fairly useless in
	practice, and it was not intentional to introduce a semantic
	change. With 1.2.2 we return to the 1.0 semantics, with a much better
	implementation that provides correct glyph metrics.

	Fix create_similar to preserve fallback resolution and font options (Behdad Esfahbod)
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	There has been a long-standing issue with cairo_surface_create_similar
	such that font options and other settings from the original
	destination surface would not be preserved to the intermediate
	"similar" surface. This could result in incorrect rendering
	(particularly with respect to text hinting/antialiasing) with
	fallbacks, for example.

	xlib: Fix text performance regression from 1.0 to 1.2.0 (Vladimir Vukicevic)
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Several people noticed that upgrading from cairo 1.0 to cairo 1.2.0
	caused a significant performance regression when using the xlib
	backend. This performance regression was particularly noticeable when
	doing lots of text rendering and when using a high-latency connection
	to the X server, (such as a remote X server over an ssh
	connection). The slowdown was identified and fixed in 1.2.2.

	PDF: Eliminate dependency on FreeType library dependency (Adrian Johnson)
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The cairo 1.2 series adds a supported pdf backend to cairo. In cairo
	1.2.0 this backend required the freetype library, which was an
	undesirable dependency on systems such as win32, (cairo is designed to
	always prefer the "native" font system). As of cairo 1.2.2 the
	freetype library is not required to use the pdf backend on the win32
	platform.

	PDF: Fix so that dashing doesn't get stuck on (Kent Worsnop)
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Kent notices that with the PDF backend in cairo 1.2.0 as soon as a
	stroke was performed with dashing, all subsequent strokes would also
	be dashed. There was no way to turn dashing off again.
