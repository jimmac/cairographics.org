	Snapshot 1.1.10 (2006-06-16 Carl Worth <cworth@cworth.org>)
	===========================================================
	This is the fifth in a series of snapshots working toward the 1.2
	release of cairo.
	
	The primary motivation for this snapshot is to fix a long-standing bug
	that had long been silent, but as of the 1.1.8 snapshot started
	causing crashes when run against 16-bit depth X servers, (often Xvnc
	or Xnest). The fix for this adds a new CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB16_565 to the
	API.
	
	This snapshot also includes a rewrite of cairo's SVG backend to
	eliminate the dependency on libxml2. With this in place, cairo 1.2
	will not depend on any libraries that cairo 1.0 did not.
	
	As usual, there are also a few fixes for minor bugs.
