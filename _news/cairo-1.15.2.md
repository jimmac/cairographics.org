Release 1.15.2     (2015-12-10 Bryce Harrington <bryce@osg.samsung.com>)
========================================================================
This release is largely a rollup to include a variety of fixes that
didn't make the cut for the stable 1.14.2 and 1.14.4 releases, as well
as all the fixes from those releases.  Notably this includes a highly
requested new API for Win32 surfaces.

For a complete log of changes since the last release, please see:

    http://cairographics.org/releases/ChangeLog.cairo-1.15.2

Features
--------
None

API Changes
-----------

  cairo_win32_surface_create_with_format

    Added a cairo API to set up Win32 surfaces for HDC with alpha
    channels.

Dependency Changes
------------------
None

Performance Optimizations
-------------------------
None

Bug Fixes
---------
* All the bug fixes from 1.14.2, 1.14.4, and 14.6

* Fix xcb/xlib compilation and calls.  Make image boxes behave when SHM
  is not available.

* Fix various issues with printing and transparent images on Win32.

* Fix thin lines that don't show up when printing in Inkscape due to
  overly aggressive culling.
  (Bug #77298)

* Fix broken printing via pdf when glyph 0 is used for rendering,
  resulting in missing spaces and letters.
  (Bug #89082)

* Fix crash for certain glyphs in opentype fonts.
  (Bug #91902)

* Fix incorrect rendering of SVG paths with more than one subpath.  If
  more than one trap is passed in then it's guaranteed that the returned
  traps will have their left edge to the left of their right edge, but
  if only one trap is passed in then the function always returns without
  doing anything.
  (Bug #90984)

* Improve rendering with Quarts to better match pixman's blending and
  filtering behavior.
