	Release 1.12.2 (2012-04-29 Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>)
	===================================================================
	After such a long gestation period for the release of Cairo 1.12, we
	inevitably accumulated a few bugs that were flushed out by broadening the
	test base. Thanks to everybody who tried the release, apologies to any one
	unfortunate enough to encounter a bug and many thanks for reporting it. As
	a result Adrian Johnson, Alexandros Frantzis, Andrea Canciani, Kalev
	Lember, Maarten Bosman, Marcus Meissner, Nis Martensen and Uli Schlachter
	have squashed many more bugs and improved the documentation. I would
	strongly recommend everyone to upgrade to cairo-1.12.2.
	-Chris
