	========================================================================
	This snapshot provides the new support for writing floating point
	formats as 16 bpc PNGs, with support for RGBA128F and RGB96F formats.
	This new feature increases Cairo's pixman version requirement to 0.36.0.
	
	Beyond this are a range of bugfixes and some work on establishing CI for
	Cairo.
