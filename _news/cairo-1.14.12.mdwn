	What is cairo
	-------------
	Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
	devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
	System (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers,
	as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
	include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.
	
	Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
	modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
