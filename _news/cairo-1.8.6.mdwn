	http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.8.6.tar.gz
	
	    which can be verified with:
	
	http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.8.6.tar.gz.sha1

	  Additionally, a git clone of the source tree:
	
	git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/cairo
	
	    will include a signed 1.8.6 tag which points to a commit named:

	    which can be verified with:
	git verify-tag 1.8.6
	
	    and can be checked out with a command such as:
	git checkout -b build 1.8.6
	
	The cairo community is pleased to announce the 1.8.6 release of the
	cairo graphics library. This is the third update to cairo's stable
	1.8 series and contains a small number of bug fixes (in particular a
	few fixes for failures of cairo 1.8.4 on Quartz and PDF, and build fixes
	for a couple of backends). This is being released just under a month
	after cairo 1.8.4.
	
	We recommend that everyone using cairo upgrade to 1.8.6.

	Build fixes
	-----------
	Fix build of DirectFB backend with debugging enabled:
	
	   Bug in _cairo_directfb_surface_release_source_image function
	   http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18322
	
	Fix build on OS/2.
	
	Bug fixes
	---------
	Workaround a mis-compilation of cairo_matrix_invert() that generated
	invalid matrices and triggered assertion failures later. The issue was
	reported by Peter Hercek.
	
	Invalid computation of the modulus:
	
	   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=466258
	
	Invalid referencing of patterns in the Quartz backend:
	
	   Failed assertion `CAIRO_REFERENCE_COUNT_HAS_REFERENCE
	   (&pattern->ref_count)' when using cairo quartz backend
	   http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18632
	
	Invalid references to glyphs after early culling, causing segmentation
	faults in the PDF backend:
	
	http://lists.cairographics.org/archives/cairo/2008-December/015976.html
	
	Check for XRender in the XCB backend, or else we may attempt an invalid
	memory access:
	
	    XCB backend fails with missing render.
