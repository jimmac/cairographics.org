Release 1.12.0 (2012-03-23 Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>)
===================================================================
It's taken over 18 months, but the wait is finally over. A new cairo release!
We are pleased to annouce a new stable release of Cairo that brings many
new features and performance improvements, all whilst maintaining
compatibility with cairo-1.0 and all releases since. We recommend anyone
using a previous release of Cairo to upgrade to 1.12.0.

The major feature of this release is the introduction of a new procedural
pattern; the mesh gradient. This, albeit complex, gradient is constructed
from a set of cubic Bezier patches and is a superset of all other gradient
surfaces which allows for the construction of incredibily detailed patterns.
In PDF parlance, the mesh gradient corresponds with type 7 patterns. Many
thanks to Andrea Canciani for bringing this to Cairo, and for his work on
making gradient handling robust.

Not content with just adding another procedural pattern, Cairo 1.12 also
adds new API to create a callback pattern,
cairo_pattern_create_raster_source, that allows the application to
provide the pixel data for the region of interest at the time of
rendering. This can be used for instance, by an application to decode
compressed images on demand and to keep a cache of those decompressed
images, independently of Cairo. When combined with the recording
surface, it should form a useful basis for a deferred renderer.

With the release of cairo-1.12, we also introduce a new supported
backend for interoperating with X using XCB. Uli Schlachter, also
maintainer of awesome and contributor to libxcb, has volunteered to
maintain cairo-xcb for us. Thanks Uli!

For cairo-1.12, we have also added some common API to address any
surface as an image and so allow direct modification of the raster data.
Previously, only the Quartz and Win32 backends supported a very narrow
interface to allow for efficient pixel upload. Now with
cairo_surface_create_similar_image, cairo_surface_map_to_image, and
cairo_surface_unmap_image, Cairo exports a consistent method for
treating those surfaces as an image and so allow modification inplace.
These are the same routines used internally, and should support
efficient transfer or direct mapping of the target surfaces as
applicable.

Another focus over the past year has been to address many performance
issues, without sacrificing the composition model. To accomplish the
goal, once again the rasterisation pipeline was overhauled and made
explicit, giving the backends the freedom to implement their own
specific pipeline whilst also providing a library of common routines
from which to build the pipeline. For instance, this allows the image
backend and the gl backend to composite scan line primitives inplace,
and to then implement custom fallbacks to catch the corner cases that do
not map onto their fastest paths. Similarly, this allows for the Xlib
backend to implement trapezoidation without compromising the other
backends, yet still allow for the pipeline to be used elsewhere for
testing and fallbacks. Clipping was once again overhauled, so that the
common cases for the raster pipelines could be captured and processed
with fast paths with the emphasis on performing geometric clipping to
reduce the frequency of using multi-pass clipmasks. Stroking was made
faster, both by providing specialised fast-paths for simple, yet frequent,
cases (such as stroking around a rectangle) and by reducing the number
of edges generated by the general stroker.

As part of the focus on performance, Cairo 1.12 introduces some
antialias hints (NONE,FAST, GOOD, BEST) that are interpolated by the
raserisers to fine tune their performance versus quality. Cairo 1.12
also introduces a new observation architecture,
cairo_surface_observer_t, which can be used to analyse the amount of
time consumed by drawing commands and help identify inefficiencies in
both Cairo and the application.

Last, but by no means least, the OpenGL backend has seen significant
work including the port to GLESv2 and the exploitation of advanced
hardware features. Interesting times.

As always, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to Cairo,
not only through writing code, but also submitting documentation, bug
reports, suggestions and generally having fun with Cairo! In particular
though this release could not have happened without the efforts of
Adrian Johnson, Alexandros Frantiz, Andrea Canicani, Martin Robinson,
Nis Martensen, and Uli Schlachter. Thanks.

What is cairo
=============
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System, quartz, win32, and image buffers, as well as PDF, PostScript,
and SVG file output. Experimental backends include OpenGL, XCB, BeOS,
OS/2, and DirectFB.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available
(for example, through the X Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling
cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,
and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,
etc.).

Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern
2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been
designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not
having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed
somewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.

Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version
1.1.
