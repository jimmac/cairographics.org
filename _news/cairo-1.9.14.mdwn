	Snapshot 1.9.14 (2010-07-26)
	============================

	  A quiet couple of weeks, hopefully Cairo is seeing widescale deployment and
	  we are being to see the results of the stabilisation effort. Clipping bugs
	  seems to have been the order of the last couple of weeks, with a couple
	  reported and duly fixed. Thank you Igor Nikitin and Karl Tomlinsion for
	  finding those regressions. At this point all that seems to remain to do is
	  to fix the outstanding regressions in the PDF backend...
