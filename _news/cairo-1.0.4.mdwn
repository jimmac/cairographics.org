	This is a maintenance (bug-fix only) release in the cairo 1.0 series.
	It is the next such release after 1.0.2 release of last October.
	(cairo versioning scheme reserves 1.0.3 for the development
	version between 1.0.2 and 1.0.4.)
	
	This release maintains source and binary compatibility with cairo
	1.0.2.
	
	This is a bug fix release.  Many fixes in this release are
	backported from the head branch and do not have bug numbers. For
	the bugs in bugzilla that are fixed in this release, see:

	This includes the bug causing Pango crashes with some corrupt
	fonts.  For a list of all changes, see ChangeLog.
	
	
	Enjoy!
