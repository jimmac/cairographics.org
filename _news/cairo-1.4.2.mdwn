	Subject: cairo release 1.4.2 now available
	
	A new cairo release 1.4.2 is now available from:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.4.2.tar.gz
	
	    which can be verified with:
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.4.2.tar.gz.sha1
	        9e7a323fc7d81d5011044d7eb22db3bf26ff7314  cairo-1.4.2.tar.gz
	
	        http://cairographics.org/releases/cairo-1.4.2.tar.gz.sha1.asc
	        (signed by Carl Worth)
	
	  Additionally, a git clone of the source tree:
	
	        git clone git://git.cairographics.org/git/cairo
	
	    will include a signed 1.4.2 tag which points to a commit named:
	        aba2b299db163d8a5b9d0a0214cd8a485fb87162
	
	    which can be verified with:
	        git verify-tag 1.4.2
	
	    and can be checked out with a command such as:
	        git checkout -b build 1.4.2
	
	This is the first update release in cairo's stable 1.4 series. It
	comes just less than 2 weeks after 1.4.0. We hadn't anticipated an
	update this early, but we've managed to collect some important fixes
	that we wanted to get out to cairo users as soon as possible, (6 fixes
	for crashes, 1 case where graphical elements would not be drawn at
	all, a handful of backend-specific bugs, and several important build
	fixes).
	
	There's almost nothing but bug fixes in this release, (see below one
	optimization that Behdad did sneak in), so we recommend that everyone
	upgrade to this release when possible.
	
	Thanks to the many people that worked to fix these bugs, and those
	that did the work to report them and to test the fixes, (wherever
	possible both names are credited below).

	What's new in cairo 1.4.2 since 1.4.0
	=====================================
	Critical fixes
	--------------
	• Fix a crash due to a LOCK vs. UNLOCK typo (M. Drochner fixing Carl
	  Worth's embarrassing typo).
	
	  http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10235
	
	• Fix potential buffer overflow, which on some systems with a checking
	  variant of snprintf would lead to a crash (Adrian Johnson, Stanislav
	  Brabec, and sangu).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10267
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=232576
	
	• Fix a crash in cairo_stroke_extents or cairo_in_stroke when line
	  width is 0.0. (Carl Worth and Sebastien Bacher)
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10231
	
	• Fix a crash on certain combinations of X server/video drivers (Carl
	  Worth and Tomas Carnecky).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10250
	
	• Fix a crash due to mishandling of invalid user input (Carl Worth and
	  Alexander Darovsky).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9844
	
	• xlib: Cleanup server-side glyph caches on XCloseDisplay. This
	  eliminated a crash detected by the perf suite, (and that
	  applications could have run into as well). (Chris Wilson)
	
	Other bug fixes
	---------------
	• Fix for some geometry which simply disappeared under some
	  transformations---a stroked line with an extreme skew in X, for
	  example (Carl Worth and Jonathan Watt).
	
	  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373632
	
	• SVG: Fix radial gradients for CAIRO_EXTEND_REFLECT and when r0 > r1
	  (Emmanuel Pacaud).
	
	• PDF: Set page group color space to DeviceRGB.
	
	  This fixes incorrect (muddy) transparent colors when rendering cairo
	  PDF output in some viewers. (Adrian Johnson, Adam Goode, and
	  MenTaLguY).
	
	  http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/cairo/2006-November/008551.html
	
	• win32: Return correct metrics when hinting is off, and fix font
	  descent computation (Behdad Esfahbod).
	
	• quartz: Fix glyph interfaces to correctly return user-space rather
	  than device-space coordinates (Brian Ewins).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9568
	
	• xcb: Fix parameter-order confusion with xcb_create_pixmap, which now
	  makes all tests that pass with xlib now pass with xcb (Carl Worth,
	  Jamey Sharp).
	
	• Fix some memory leaks in the perf suite (Chris Wilson).
	
	• Fix perf suite to consider changes in pixman/src (Mathias
	  Hasselmann).
	
	Build fixes
	-----------
	• Don't include pre-generated cairo-features.h file. This was causing
	  build failures when building with the directfb backend enabled
	  (Behdad Esfahbod).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10189
	
	• Eliminate use of maintainer mode from cairo's automake/configure
	  script. This means that updates to files such as Makefile.am will
	  take effect, (by rerunning automake and friends as necessary) when
	  invoking make rather than being silently ignored.  (Behdad Esfahbod)
	
	• Don't compile cairo-deflate-stream.c, which depends on zlib, unless
	  building the pdf backend which requires it. (Carl Worth, Tor
	  Lillqvist)
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10202
	
	• Don't make the ps backend link against zlib anymore, since it
	  doesn't require it (Carl Worth).
	
	• Use "find !" rather than "find -not" for better portability (Thomas
	  Klausner).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10226
	
	• Don't use unsupported visibility attribute "hidden" on Solaris
	  (Gilles Dauphin, Thomas Klausner).
	
	  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10227
	
	Optimization
	------------
	• It was Behdad that suggested we focus strictly on bug fixes now that
	  we shipped so many performance improvements in 1.4.0, but it was
	  also Behdad that got distracted by the chance to remove a lot of
	  mallocs from cairo. Paths, gstates, trapezoids, splines, polygons,
	  and gradient color stops will now use small, stack-allocated buffers
	  in the most common cases rather than calling malloc as
	  often. (Behdad Esfahbod). And look for more from Mathias Hasselmann
	  soon.
