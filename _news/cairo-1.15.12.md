Release 1.15.12    (2018-04-04 Bryce Harrington <bryce@osg.samsung.com>)
========================================================================
The main focus for this release is the addition of Variable Font
support.  Variable fonts are single font files with various typography
characteristics, such as weight or slant, that users of the font can
adjust between two points.  Effectively this enables a single font to
behave as multiple fonts.

The Skia backend is disabled in this release, due to severe bitrot, and
will be removed in future releases.  Contact the cairo team if you have
a need of this backend.

What is cairo
-------------
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output
devices. Currently supported output targets include the X Window
System (via both Xlib and XCB), quartz, win32, and image buffers,
as well as PDF, PostScript, and SVG file output. Experimental backends
include OpenGL, BeOS, OS/2, and DirectFB.

Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media
while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available
(for example, through the X Render Extension).

The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo include stroking and filling
cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images,
and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be
transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear,
etc.).

Cairo has been designed to let you draw anything you want in a modern
2D graphical user interface.  At the same time, the cairo API has been
designed to be as fun and easy to learn as possible. If you're not
having fun while programming with cairo, then we have failed
somewhere---let us know and we'll try to fix it next time around.

Cairo is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or
modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version
1.1.
